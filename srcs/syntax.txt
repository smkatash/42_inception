openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 365 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/ktashbae.key \
	-out /etc/nginx/ssl/ktashbae.csr -subj /CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}

-newkey arg :  creates a new certificate request and a new private key. 
The argument takes one of several forms. rsa:nbits, where nbits is the number of bits, 
generates an RSA key nbits in size. 
-new: generates a new certificate request
-nodes: if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.
-x509: a self signed certificate instead of a certificate request. 
-days n : when the -x509 option is being used this specifies the number of 
days to certify the certificate for.
-keyout [filename] :  filename to write the newly created private key to.
-out filename: the output filename to write to or standard output by default
-.csr is a certificate signing request, a challenge used by a trusted third party to 
verify the ownership of a keypair without having direct access to the private key
- subj arg: replaces subject field of input request with specified data and outputs 
modified request.
